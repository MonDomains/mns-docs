# Introduction

## What is the Mon Name Service?

The Mon Name Service (MNS) is a decentralized, open-source, and extensible naming system built on Monad blockchain. It’s compatible with ENS that makes it easy to integrate.

MNS maps human-readable names like ‘alice.mon’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Monad addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, metadata, and more. MNS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as primary names or interface descriptions with Monad addresses.

Top-Level Domains (TLD) .mon is owned by smart contracts called registrar, which specify rules governing the allocation of their names. Enabling seamless interoperability with the DNS (Domain Name System).

## Mon Registrar

The MON Registrar is the registrar for the .mon TLD, it allows for trustless decentralized names to be issued as tokens on the Monad Blockchain. Registration is done through smart-contracts, and name ownership is secured by the Monad blockchain.

## Subnames

Because of the hierarchal nature of MNS, anyone who owns a domain at any level can take control of resolution. Users can create subdomains manually, or take matters into their own hands and write their own resolution logic.

For instance, if Alice owns ‘alice.mon’, she can create ‘pay.alice.mon’ and configure it as she wishes. Or, use a Custom Resolver, and programmatically issue subdomains, for example in an App, Community, or DAO.

## MNS Manager App

You can try MNS out for yourself now by using the [MNS Manager App](https://dapp.monadns.com), or by using any of MNS enabled applications.
